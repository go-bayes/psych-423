That’s not perfect. For example, its clear that birds, chimps, and other organisms have culture, however, this definition makes a start.\nWhat is evolution?\n\n\n\nFigure 1:  From Martin Nowak’s Five Rules For The Evolution of Cooperation\n\n\n\nWe define evolution as a process by which design accumulates in living systems under the following conditions:\nVariation within a population\nCompetition among variants\nInheritance such that there is a faithful transmission to “children” of “parental” traits.\nHere too, we have only an approximate definition to make a start.1\nWhy combine culture and evolution?\nWhen defining evolution we used shutter quotes for “children” and “parents” because evolution is not restricted to biological inheritance. There are evolutionary patterns at the level of culture.\nThere are three main benefits for combining culture and evolution:\nto clarify otherwise bewildering cultural diversity;\nto unlock wisdom in culturally inherited systems;\nto avoid to cultural evolved inequality.\nFocus on Religion\nEvolutionary Puzzle 1: religion appears to be biologically costly\n\n\n\nFigure 2: What is the Expression on this woman’s face?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3: Biological puzzle of costs\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 4: Hindu Sadus actively destroy reproductive futures\n\n\n\nEvolutionary Puzzle 2: Religion is ancient\n\n\n\nFigure 5: Evidence for ritual at least 150kya\n\n\n\nEvolutionary Puzzle 3: Religion is pervasive, and growing\n\n\n\nFigure 6: People in the New century will be religious\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 7: Diversity of one mosque: Al Noor (Christchurch\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 8: Highest levels of religious identification predict more children\n\n\n\nReligion in your backyard\n\n\n\nFigure 9: Places of faith in Wellington\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 10: Places of faith in Upper Hutte\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 11: Places of faith in Upper Hutte\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 12: Diversity of one mosque: Al Noor (Christchurch\n\n\n\nWhat will I be doing in this course?\nExpectations:\n5 x article “peer” review reports of an assigned reading = 25%.\n10 x class participation + engagement points = 10%.\n1 x student led presentation = 10%.\n1 x Grant application initial proposal = 15% “application inquiry” – or preliminary plan.\n1 x \"Grant application final grant = 40%\nSign up for the class participation here\n\n\n\nFigure 13: Blackboard sign up\n\n\n\nHow will this course benefit me?\nKnowledge of cultural evolutionary theory and research\nPresentation skills\nCritical sympathetic writing.\nSkills for organising a research idea, and pitching it to a potential funder.\nSlide deck\nClick here to go to the slide deck.\n\n\n\nfitvids('.shareagain', {players: 'iframe'});\n\nHelp\nYou can email me for an appointment at: joseph.bulbulia@vuw.ac.nz or drop by my office hours: here\nReadings\nNo readings this week, but check out some cultural databases and websites:\nD-PlACE\nPulotu\nDatabase of Religious History\nSeshat\nCultural diversity at the Al Noor Mosque\nCultural diversity in New Zealand as recorded by the New Zealand Attitudes and Values Study\nGlobal church map\nSource of image Martin’ Nowak’s Five Rules for the Evolution of Cooperatoin here↩︎\n",
