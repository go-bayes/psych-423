That’s not perfect. For example, its clear that birds, chimps, and other organisms have culture, however, this definition makes a start.\nWhat is evolution?\nWe define evolution as a process by which design accumulates in living systems under the following conditions:\nVariation within a population\nCompetition among variants\nInheritance such that there is a faithful transmission to “children” of “parental” traits.\nHere too, we an approximate definition to make a start.\nWhy combine culture and evolution?\nWhen defining evolution we used shutter quotes for “children” and “parents” because evolution is not restricted to biological inheritance. There are evolutionary patterns at the level of culture.\nThere are three main benefits for combining culture and evolution:\nto clarify otherwise bewildering cultural diversity;\nto unlock wisdom in culturally inherited systems;\nto avoid to cultural evolved inequality.\nWhat will I be doing in this course?\nExpectations:\nYou’ll participate in seminars (which means attending).\nYou’ll lead a seminar discussion\nYou’ll write 4 x peer review reports\nYou’ll develop a “grant proposal” for conducting cultural evolutionary research.\nHow will this course benefit me?\nKnowledge of cultural evolutionary theory and research\nPresentation skills\nCritical sympathetic writing.\nSkills for organising a research idea, and pitching it to a potential funder.\nSlide deck\nClick here to go to the slide deck.\n\n\n\nfitvids('.shareagain', {players: 'iframe'});\n\nHelp\nYou can email me for an appointment at: joseph.bulbulia@vuw.ac.nz or drop by my office hours: here\nReadings\nVisit D-PlACE\n\n\n\n",
