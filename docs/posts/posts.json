It is an assumption, not a result.\nThe principle of consistency\nWe can be held accountable to our beliefs.\nFor example:\nYou believe that Abel Tasman is south of Wellington\nYou believe that maps can be trusted.\nYou look up Abel Tasman at 40.9347° S\nYou look up Wellington at 41.2865° S\nYour beliefs are inconsistent\nThe cognitive revolution\nKey idea: thinking is a kind of information processing.\nCognitive scientists claim that both the brain and computers need to be approached abstractly and from a non-materialist point of view.\nThinking (and computers) involves transforming information through symbolic representation according to rules\nImplication: to understand thinking requires understanding rules (not neurons or any other material “stuff”)\n\n\n\nFigure 1: We perceive color constancy under different lightening condition, even as light frequencies vary.

That’s not perfect. For example, its clear that birds, chimps, and other organisms have culture, however, this definition makes a start.\nWhat is evolution?\n\n\n\nFigure 1:  From Martin Nowak’s Five Rules For The Evolution of Cooperation\n\n\n\nWe define evolution as a process by which design accumulates in living systems under the following conditions:\nVariation within a population\nCompetition among variants\nInheritance such that there is a faithful transmission to “children” of “parental” traits.\nHere too, we have only an approximate definition to make a start.1\nWhy combine culture and evolution?\nWhen defining evolution we used shutter quotes for “children” and “parents” because evolution is not restricted to biological inheritance. There are evolutionary patterns at the level of culture.\nThere are three main benefits for combining culture and evolution:\nto clarify otherwise bewildering cultural diversity;\nto unlock wisdom in culturally inherited systems;\nto avoid to cultural evolved inequality.\nFocus on Religion\nReligions prominently display cultural variation\nFrom the healing rituals of Kalahari foragers to monumental Aztec sacrificial theaters, religion spans the full range of human experiences. (See (fig:religions))\n\n\n\nFigure 2:  Religions exhibit strong cultural variation?\n\n\n\nTraditional scholars of religion have long argued that the best we can do is to describe religious diversity.\nAs we shall see next week, cognitive scientists of religion have urged that religious diversity is an illusion.\nAre California Buddhist Fruit-arians and murderous Aztecs priests variations on the same theme? If not, is the best we can do as academics is to describe their differences? Or might there be systematic patterns across religious cultural diversity. If so, might we detect and decipher these patterns? And what might such patterns teach us about the role of religion in social life?\nApproaching cultural varation using by melding ethnographic, historical, and biological toolkits\nSimilar questions have arisen for species, where computational phylogenetic methods have afforded substantial progress in detecting, and deciphering systematic patterns in the extraordinary diversity of species. Figure 3 depicts the magnificent morphological variation of Eastern Wood Warblers.2\n\n\n\nFigure 3:  Eastern Wood Warblers?\n\n\n\nThough we might spend a lives describing the diversity of this and other lineages,\nit is possible to infer family histories using computational phylogenetic methods. From these histories, the timing and rates of branching between species in the Eastern Wood Warblers have be estimated. Rates of evolution within clades have also be inferred (see 4).\n\n\n\nFigure 4:  Eastern Wood Warbler Phylogeny: what do the historical patterns suggest about causes of the morphological variation that we observe today?\n\n\n\nHere we see an early burst of speciation followed by stasis. This pattern is consistent with theories of speciation for which there were early ecological opportunities, evolution to fill the gaps, and then a long period of relative status. We might use this pattern to inquire about what opportunities presented early on, and whether the variation that occurred early on related to task-specific functions that the natural and social ecologies of that time afforded.\nIn the weeks ahead, we will explore the interest of similar approaches to the cultural diversity of religions (See Figure 5.\n\n\n\nFigure 5:  Image is from a global phylogeny of religion that Russell Gray, Anastasia Ejova, Oliver Sheehan, and Remco Bourkart and others (including me) are preparing at the Max Planck Institute for the Science of Human History. What do the patterns of religious diversification tell us about the histories of the world’s major faiths?\n\n\n\nEvolutionary Puzzle 1: religion appears to be biologically costly\n\n\n\nFigure 6:  What is the Expression on this woman’s face?\n\n\n\nFigure 6 is photograph that my colleague Ron Fischer took when were in Mauritius investigating the emotional dynamics in highly arousal rituals. What expression is the woman conveying in this image?\n\n\n\nFigure 7:  Biological puzzle of costs\n\n\n\nIf you guessed sorrow, you are correct. The woman was weeping so loudly that the little boy in the background had to cup his ears (See Figure 7).\nFrom a biological vantage point, we might a species to actively avoid unnecessary suffering and bodily damage. However, as we shall repeatedly see throughout this course, rituals are frequently associated with costs and risks. As evident in Figure 1, conservation implies adaptation. Where’s the adaptation in costly rituals? Why, are costly rituals conserved?\n\n\n\nFigure 8:  Hindu Sadus actively destroy reproductive futures. This is biologically puzzling\n\n\n\nThe image in Figure 8 is of a Sadhu. A Sadhu is a religious ascetics who take vows of self-denial to achieve ”mosksha” – which in the Hindu tradition is a state of liberation. The acetic regimes are associated with contemplative practices such as prayers and mantra recitations. The austerity is thought to remove the spiritual effects of karma (action) which cause ,may cause future states of unhappiness. Why would an anthropologist from Mars be puzzled by these Hindu Saddhus?\nEvolutionary Puzzle 2: Religion is ancient\nOn the human capacity to fathom geological time scales, Darwin writes:\n\nIt is hardly possible for me even to recall to the reader, who may not be a practical geologist, the facts leading the mind feebly to comprehend the lapse of time … – Charles Darwin, Origins of Species, p.283\nIt strikes me that all our knowledge about the structure of our Earth is very much like what an old hen would know of the hundred-acre field in a corner of which she is scratching. –Charles Darwin, Life and Letters of Charles Darwin vol 2, p.348)\n\nWe tend to think of the ancient Greeks and Romans as inhabiting the deep human past. However anatomically modern humans have been around about 200,000 years.\n\n\n\nFigure 9: Evidence for ritual at least 150kya\n\n\n\nRituals have been around as long as humans have been around, and perhaps longer. The Figure 9 draws the archaeological evidence for rituals on a time line.\nHere’s a thought experiment:\nImagine that distance from the present to the origins of Christianity (about 2000 years) is one step.\nNote that it would take another 15 steps before we reached the evidence of supernatural art in European caves Clottes and Chauvet. Go ahead and find a place were you can walk 15 steps. As you are counting, imagine the passing of 2000 years with each pace. During those spans of time, there were humans just like you and I who were getting on with the business of their lives.\nDouble that distance again, and we reach the Blombos caves in South Africa, where archaeologists describe function-less artifacts that indicate (to archaeologists, anyway) evidence of symbolic thinking.\nAdd another 15 paces and we arrive at Quafez burials of Hominins close relatives the neanderthals. The layout of a child’s grave with artefacts and attentive orientation appears to signify a supernatural drama. Were these thoughts religious?\nFinally, it will take us another 25 steps to reach the Herto finds in Ethiopia, where Tim White found skulls with etchings indicting that they were fastened to chords and swung. Were the rituals imagining an afterlife into which the dead travelled?\nOf course, we can only speculate about the events of the deep ancestral human past. However, the fact that people were engaging in symbolic rituals is consistent with supernatural speculation. Why was religion conserved all that time?\n\nNetflix advice: watch Werner Herzog’s Caves of Dreams, which describes this rediscovery of Chauvet in the late 20th century.\nEvolutionary Puzzle 3: Religion is pervasive, and growing\nThe Pew Foundation predicts that the proportion of the religious population will grow in the future. 3\n\n\n\nFigure 10:  Pew predicts the world we encounter in the decades ahead will be increasingly religious\n\n\n\nFigure 11 shows Pew’s predictive model for New Zealand’s religious future.\n\n\n\nFigure 11:  Highest levels of religious identification predict more children\n\n\n\nWhy might religious decline in New Zealand stabalise?\nRoughly speaking, religious change at the population level is a function of two processes:\nreligious conversion/deconversion\nbirthrates of religious and non-religious people\nThere are only two pathways for having a religion or losing religion. You are born into a family that has/doesn’t have a religion. You convert/de-convert. Figure 12 presents the expected number of children by for people living in New Zealand by religious affiliation. The red line is the biological replacement threshold of 2 x children (for a population to maintain its numbers each person must have an average of 2 x kids because each child has 2 x parents).\n\n\n\nFigure 12:  Highest levels of religious identification predict more children\n\n\n\nReligion in your backyard\nThough not an evolutionary puzzle, it is important to understand religion because it is a common feature of life in our communities.
