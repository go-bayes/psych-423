To what extent is social behaviour different or the same\nacross the world? What theories can we use to understand the thoughts,\nfeelings, actions, and beliefs of people across cultures? Emphasis is on\nsuch basic social processes as construction of identity and personality,\ndimensions of cultural variation, and intergroup harmony and conflict.\nIssues towards developing cross-cultural competence are considered, with\nan eye towards establishing better practices for the evolving population\nof Aotearoa/New Zealand.\nAssessments\nSee: Assessments\nReligion as a\nWindow into Culture and Behaviour\nThis year, we will use religion as a window through which to view\npatterns of cultural variation and similarity.\nFrom the healing rituals of the Kung people in southern Africa, to\nthe human sacrificial rituals of the Aztecs, to the liberating speeches\nof Martin Luther King, human spirituality is both diverse and powerful.\nWhat explains the near universality of religion? What explains its\ndiversity of forms? Are religions like typewriters, once useful but now\nobsolete? Or will religions remain vital for humanity’s future. Here, we\ninvestigate these questions from the perspective of cultural\nevolution.\nSee\nour church_Map\nCommunication\nof additional information and submissions\nLectures will be posted to: https://go-bayes.github.io/psych-423/\nCourse-Related notices will appear on VUW Blackboard\nAny information relating to Psyc 423 or any last-minute changes to\nthe course will be posted on Blackboard.\nStudents must submit all written work to VUW Blackboard.\nImportant dates\nTrimester dates: 22 February to 20 June Teaching dates: 22 February\nto 28 May\nMid-trimester break: 5 April to 18 April\nLast assessment item due: Final assessment (research proposal) will\nneed to be submitted on 31st May see: Assessments\nStudy Examination/Assessment Period: Note: students who enrol in\ncourses with examinations must be able to attend an examination at the\nUniversity at any time during the scheduled examination period.\nWithdrawal dates: Refer to Withdrawing\nIf you cannot complete an assignment or sit a test or examination\n(aegrotats), refer to Aegrotats\nTeaching Format\nPsyc423 is a 15pt course which represents approx. 150 hours of total\nwork for an average student.\nIn-class time involves (approx. 22hrs):\nLectures by academic staff (typically Bulbulia): Lectures will\nintroducing basic areas of knowledge, and will supplement the\nreadings.\nClass discussions. I expect students to read the assigned\narticles for the relevant week. To receive participation credit,\nstudents must attent seminar and submit a brief (~100 word) account of a\nthought, question, or insight that occurred to them during the class\ndiscussion.\nThe reports and “grant” assessments are described in Assessments)\nNote: this course has no tests or examinations.\nOut-of-class time involves (approx. 128hrs):\nReading articles before & following class.\nReading materials for the student presentations and writing response\npapers.\nResearch project readings & preparation\nResearch proposal writing\nMandatory course\nrequirements\nThere are no Mandatory course requirements.\nWorkload\nGiven that Psyc 423 is a 15 point course, the expected workload is no\nless than 150 hours in total. This would mean roughly 15 hours per week.\nThis should be viewed as a minimum - how much you get out of this course\nwill depend on the work you put in.\nPenalties\nStudents must turn in all assignments on time by due dates. If\nstudents do not turn in an essay or assignment at a designated time,\nthey will receive a zero for assignment this will be counted toward the\nfinal grade.\nMaterials and\nequipment and/or additional expenses\nYou will not be needing any additional equipment or materials.\nRecommended reading\nMost of the material students will be expected to read is published\nin journals and to some extent in books. Students will need to read\nbetween two and five articles per week. Set readings will mostly be\nsupplied throughout the course (please check relevant week in\nBlackBoard). However, students will also be required to conduct their\nown independent reviews of the literature for assignment purposes.\nOther important information\nThe information above is specific to this course. There is other\nimportant information that students must familiarise themselves with,\nincluding:\nAcademic\nIntegrity/Plagiarism\nAcademic\nProgress\nDates\nand deadlines\nFaculty\nof Science Student and Academic Services Office\nGrades\nSpecial passes Refer to the Assessment\nHandbook\nStatutes and\npolicies\nStudent\nsupport\nStudents with\ndisabilities\nStudent\nCharter\nTerms\nand Conditions\nTurnitin\nUniversity\nstructure\nVUWSA\nTopics and Readings\nWeek 1: Overview\nWeek 2: Evolutionary\nPsychology\nCosmides, Leda, and John Tooby. “Evolutionary psychology: A primer.”\n(1997).

However\nplease note that the full proposal summary (up to 200 words in\nlength) is different from the shorter summary required in the\nEOI, both in terms of length and the intended audience. It should\nsummarise the proposed research in straightforward language, but without\nloss of accuracy or excessive over-simplification. Note that this will\nbe made publicly available should the proposal be successful, and may be\npublished as part of the Marsden Fund’s publicity.\nIf the summary contains confidential or sensitive material, please\nindicate this at the summary start: “This summary contains sensitive or\nconfidential information and will be released when the contract is\ncompleted”.\nAs for the EOI, the type of research activity is not accessible to\nanyone involved in the assessment of the proposals.\nSections\n2a – 2d: Background, Overall Aim, Proposed Research and Vision\nMātauranga\nIf no Vision Mātauranga theme is identified in Section 3, the\ntotal page limit for this section is five pages, with no set limit for\neach section within this.\nIf one or more Vision Mātauranga theme is identified in\nSection 3, the total page limit for this section is six pages*\nwith no set limit for each section within this. Please read the\ndefinitions of these sections clearly, and avoid repetition.\nSection 2a: Background\nUse this section to give a context for the proposal by\nsummarising in plain language the state of knowledge in the\nfield.\nSection 2b: Overall Aim\nof the Research\nUse this section to state the general goals and specific\nobjectives of the research proposal. Outline the potential for\nsignificant scholarly impact of your proposal (incorporating novelty,\noriginality, insight and ambition).\nSection 2c: Proposed Research\nThis section should cover, where appropriate, the hypotheses\nbeing tested, the methodology to be used,\nsampling design, and methods of data analysis. Please ensure that your\ndescription covers the period of funding sought (up to three years), and\nthat it includes contributions by collaborators and postgraduate\nstudents (if any).\nIf you identify one or more Vision Mātauranga themes in Section 3,\nplease elaborate here how this fits in with your proposed research. For\nexample, you may wish to discuss consultations and linkages, relevance,\nconceptual framework and/or proposal design, and outcomes (in addition\nto statements in Section 2d).\nWe are keen to see an increased emphasis on ethical considerations of\nthe proposed research, particularly in the social sciences\ndisciplines.\nIf the proposed research requires ethics approval, please use this\nsection to show that you have considered all of the ethics issues\nassociated with your research. Your discussion should satisfy the panel\nthat your processes are meaningful, and for social science disciplines\nin particular, that you have fully considered how your methods will\naffect the communities you are working with. It is important that you do\nnot concentrate solely on your theoretical argument at the neglect of\nmethodology, implementation, and community safety.\nSection 2d: Vision Mātauranga\nPlease refer to earlier guidelines on Vision\nMātauranga.\nIf you identify one or more Vision Mātauranga themes in Section 3,\nplease include discussion of this within Section 2d, for example, on\nconsultation and linkages, relevance, conceptual framework and/or\nproposal design, and outcomes.\nStatements on Vision Mātauranga should be contained within Section\n2d, following the description of research (Sections 2a-2c). This is to\nenable Vision Mātauranga to be more easily integrated into the\nconceptual framework and/or research design. Where Vision Mātauranga is\nappropriate to a proposal, it can contribute to the overall\nexcellence.\nCompliance aspects, such as access to culturally sensitive material\nand knowledge, should be covered in Section 2h, “Ethical or Regulatory\nObligations”.\nAspects of Vision Mātauranga relating to relevant experience can be\nincluded in the “Roles and Resources” section (2g) and can also be\nincorporated into sections 2a-2c.\nSection 2e: References\nReferences for the Background, Overall Aims, Proposed Research and\nVision Mātauranga sections (Sections 2a-d) should be listed here in\nSection 2e, and should not exceed three pages in length.\nSection 2f: Timetable\nDescribe in general terms the advances you hope to make in each year.\nIt is acknowledged that this timetable may be revised as the research\nprogresses.\nResources:\nClearly state the resources required for the proposed research that\nthe team will have access to. This is an opportunity to discuss the\npractical requirements of your proposed research. For example: Access to\nlibraries/collections/archives; access to required\ninstruments/equipment/techniques/materials; ability to do fieldwork\n(e.g. site access, assistance, etc.); access to pools of\nparticipants.\nIf there are any special requirements for the proposed research,\nplease explain how these will be met.\nSection 2h:\nEthical or Regulatory Obligations\nAny permissions, approvals, etc., should be listed in this\nsection.\nIt is your responsibility to ensure that all ethical or regulatory\nobligations are met (for example, from ERMA, MPI, Animal Ethics, Human\nEthics). It is also your responsibility to organise access to\nfacilities, fieldwork sites, archives, materials etc. This section\nshould make clear that you have anticipated or gained the necessary\nformal approvals for your intended research, for instance, Department of\nConservation permits, ERMA permits, and so forth.\nResearchers should plan the necessary approvals well in advance, to\nensure no delays to the project should it be funded. Researchers should\ncontact their institutional ethics committee and research offices for\nfurther information. Researchers will need to provide information on the\ncurrent state of their ethics approval.\nNote that only compliance aspects related to ethical or regulatory\nconsiderations should be covered here. Ethical considerations in the\ncontext of the research methodology should be discussed in detail in the\nProposed Research section (2c), as mentioned previously.\nSocial Research\nResearchers collecting personal information should be aware of their\nobligations around obtaining consents, data security, maintaining the\nanonymity of individuals, sensitivity around cultural issues and all\nother ethical considerations as appropriate. If there is any\nuncertainty, researchers should consult their institutional ethics\ncommittee.\nThere is a requirement that any researchers working with children\nfollow the guidelines of their host institution’s child protection\npolicy, in accord with section 19 of the Vulnerable Children’s Act 2014.\nShould the host institution not have a child protection policy,\nresearchers should comply with the Society’s guidelines:\nhttps://royalsociety.org.nz/who-we-are/our-rules-and-codes/policy-on-child-protection/child-protection-policy/\nVision Mātauranga (Updated\nfor 2020)\nThese are the updated guidelines which were included in the 2020 EOI\nGuidelines. They are also available at https://www.royalsociety.org.nz/what-we-do/funds-and-opportunities/marsden/marsden-fund-application-process/submitting-a-proposal/vision-matauranga/\nBackground\nVision Mātauranga is a policy about innovation, opportunity and the\ncreation of knowledge that highlights the potential contribution of\nMāori knowledge, resources and people.\nhttps://royalsociety.org.nz/what-we-do/funds-and-opportunities/marsden/application/submitting-a-proposal/vision-matauranga/\nhttp://www.mbie.govt.nz/info-services/science-innovation/agencies-policies-budget-initiatives/vision-matauranga-policy/?searchterm=vision%20matauranga%2A\nThere are four themes:\nIndigenous Innovation, which involves contributing to economic growth\nthrough distinctive research and development;\nTaiao, which is concerned with achieving environmental sustainability\nthrough iwi and hapū relationships with land and sea;\nHauora/Oranga, which centres around improving health and social\nwellbeing; and Mātauranga, which involves exploring indigenous\nknowledge.\nVision Mātauranga and\nthe Marsden Fund\nPlease note that Vision Mātauranga is now included as an assessment\ncriterion:\nProposals should consider the relation of the research to the themes\nof Vision Mātauranga and, where relevant, how the project will engage\nwith Māori.\nAt the Full Proposal round, up to one additional page will be\navailable for statements on Vision Mātauranga immediately following the\ndescription of research in Sections 2a-2c. This is to enable Vision\nMātauranga to be more easily integrated into the conceptual framework\nand/or research design. Where Vision Mātauranga is appropriate to a\nproposal, it can contribute to the assessment of its overall\nexcellence.\nHow do I decide whether to include a Vision Mātauranga statement in\nmy proposal?\nA Vision Mātauranga statement must be included for all\nresearch that has relevance for Māori. The research category\ndescriptions outlined in the next section may help you decide if this\napplies to your project. Please note, however, that those categories are\nfluid, there may well be overlap between them, and not every point in\neach category need apply.\nCategories of Research\nThe five categories identified below have been adapted from those on\nthe National Science Challenge, Biological Heritage website https://bioheritage.nz/about-us/vision-matauranga/\nhosted by Manaaki Whenua Landcare Research. Please note that there may\nwell be overlap between categories as in categories 2 and 3 in terms of\nthe nature and degree of relevance to Māori.\nThe original categories were set out by MBIE in information for the\nEndeavour Fund c. 2015.\n1. Research with no\nspecific Māori component\nNo mātauranga Māori (Māori knowledge) is used. Māori are not\nassociated with the research process (e.g. not on any research\nmanagement / advisory / governance panels, it is not inclusive of Māori\nland or institutions, nor the subject of any component of the research).\nWork is not likely to be of greater direct relevance to Māori than\nmembers of any other group. ##### 2. Research specifically relevant to\nMāori This category includes research projects where:\nThere is specific relevance to Māori. Mātauranga Māori may be used in\na minor way to guide the work and its relevance to Māori. It includes\nwork that contributes to Māori aspirations and outcomes.\n3. Research involving Māori\nThis category includes research projects where:\nMātauranga Māori may be incorporated in the project, but is not\ncentral to the project. Research is specifically and directly relevant\nto Māori and Māori are involved in the design and/or undertaking of the\nresearch. The work typically contributes to Māori (e.g., iwi / hapū,\norganisations) aspirations and outcomes.\n4. Māori-centred research\nThis category includes research projects where:\nThe project is Māori led, and where Mātauranga Māori is used\nalongside other knowledges (e.g. through frameworks, models, methods,\ntools, etc.). Kaupapa Māori research is a key focus of the project.\nResearch is typically collaborative or consultative, with direct input\nfrom Māori groups, commonly including Māori researchers or a\ncollaboration with Māori researchers or researchers under the\nguidance/mentoring of Māori. There is alignment with and contribution to\nMāori (e.g., iwi / hapū, organisations) aspirations.\n5. Kaupapa Māori research\nThis category includes research projects where:\nMātauranga Māori is incorporated, used and understood, as a central\nfocus of project and its findings.\nResearch is grounded in te ao Māori and connected to Māori\nphilosophies and principles. Research typically uses kaupapa Māori\nresearch methodologies.\nTe reo Māori may be a central feature to this kaupapa or research\nactivity, and key researchers have medium to high cultural fluency or\nknowledge of tikanga and reo. The research is generally led by a Māori\nresearcher; non-Indigenous researchers may carry out research under the\nguidance/mentoring of a Māori researcher. Māori participation\n(iwi/hapū/marae/individual) is high. The work contributes strongly to\nMāori (e.g., iwi/hapū, organisations) aspirations and outcomes and is\nmana enhancing.\nIV. Developing a\nVision Mātauranga statement\nIt is important to keep in mind that there is no single\napproach or prescription for Vision Mātauranga: one size does\nnot fit all and there are many possible ways of addressing Vision\nMātauranga. Vision Mātauranga should not, however, be seen as an add-on,\nnor should it be treated as separate from the research, methods or\npeople involved in the project. A holistic approach that considers\nreciprocity and relationships is therefore desirable.\nVision Mātauranga does not begin and end with your Vision Mātauranga\nstatement. You should document how you have considered Vision Mātauranga\nand demonstrate applicable actions and relationships throughout the\nresearch. The following questions may be useful to consider when\nconceptualising and writing your project:\nHave you co-created the research topic/issue with an iwi or Māori\norganisation? What does working in partnership with iwi mean to you as\nresearchers?\nTo what extent have you discussed the research with Māori partners\nand agreed on the methodology you will use?\nWas there full disclosure and informed consent to the proposed\nresearch with Māori partners? How has that agreement/informed consent\nbeen agreed to?\nHas budget been disclosed and agreed to with Māori partners?\nIs there provision in that budget for Māori involvement, capability\ndevelopment and consultation?\nIs there appropriate Māori researcher involvement in the project,\nboth in terms of PI/AIs and capability development?\nWhat provisions have you made to ensure there is advice from\nappropriate Māori organisations throughout the life of the research\nproject?\nIf there are concerns or disagreements with Māori partners, how are\nthese to be resolved?\nWhat provisions have you made to ensure there is appropriate\ntechnology transfer to Māori partners as the research proceeds and as\nfindings become available towards the end of the project?\nAre there benefits to Māori? What are they? And how have these been\nagreed with Māori partners?\nHow is the project an opportunity to build the capacity of Māori\nresearchers or students in your discipline?\nHow will you share the research outcomes with Māori?\nHas there been agreement about the intellectual property ownership of\nresearch findings with Māori partners?\nWhat is the nature of that agreement?\nIs there a need for members of the research team to be proficient in\nte reo? How has this aspect been addressed?\nIs there a Tiriti o Waitangi component or requirement in your\nresearch?\nIs the research mana enhancing?\nV. Vision Mātauranga\nResources\nBelow you will find a non-exhaustive list of published resources that\ndescribe, discuss, and talk about how researchers have engaged with\nVision Mātauranga and kaupapa Māori research. These range from early\nconceptions of Vision Mātauranga to more recent frameworks.
