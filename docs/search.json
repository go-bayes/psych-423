To what extent is social behaviour different or the same across the world? What theories can we use to understand the thoughts, feelings, actions, and beliefs of people across cultures? Emphasis is on such basic social processes as construction of identity and personality, dimensions of cultural variation, and intergroup harmony and conflict. Issues towards developing cross-cultural competence are considered, with an eye towards establishing better practices for the evolving population of Aotearoa/New Zealand.\nAssessments\nSee: Assessments\nReligion as a Window into Culture and Behaviour\nThis year, we will use religion as a window through which to view patterns of cultural variation and similarity.\nFrom the healing rituals of the Kung people in southern Africa, to the human sacrificial rituals of the Aztecs, to the liberating speeches of Martin Luther King, human spirituality is both diverse and powerful. What explains the near universality of religion? What explains its diversity of forms? Are religions like typewriters, once useful but now obsolete? Or will religions remain vital for humanity’s future. Here, we investigate these questions from the perspective of cultural evolution.\nSee our church_Map\nCommunication of additional information and submissions\nLectures will be posted to: https://go-bayes.github.io/psych-423/\nCourse-Related notices will appear on VUW Blackboard\nAny information relating to Psyc 423 or any last-minute changes to the course will be posted on Blackboard.\nStudents must submit all written work to VUW Blackboard.\nImportant dates\nTrimester dates: 22 February to 20 June Teaching dates: 22 February to 28 May\nMid-trimester break: 5 April to 18 April\nLast assessment item due: Final assessment (research proposal) will need to be submitted on 31st May see: Assessments\nStudy Examination/Assessment Period: Note: students who enrol in courses with examinations must be able to attend an examination at the University at any time during the scheduled examination period. Withdrawal dates: Refer to Withdrawing If you cannot complete an assignment or sit a test or examination (aegrotats), refer to Aegrotats\nTeaching Format\nPsyc423 is a 15pt course which represents approx. 150 hours of total work for an average student.\nIn-class time involves (approx. 22hrs):\nLectures by academic staff (typically Bulbulia): Lectures will introducing basic areas of knowledge, and will supplement the readings.\nClass discussions. I expect students to read the assigned articles for the relevant week. To receive participation credit, students must attent seminar and submit a brief (~100 word) account of a thought, question, or insight that occurred to them during the class discussion.\nThe reports and “grant” assessments are described in Assessments)\nNote: this course has no tests or examinations.\nOut-of-class time involves (approx. 128hrs):\nReading articles before & following class.\nReading materials for the student presentations and writing response papers.\nResearch project readings & preparation\nResearch proposal writing\nMandatory course requirements\nThere are no Mandatory course requirements.\nWorkload\nGiven that Psyc 423 is a 15 point course, the expected workload is no less than 150 hours in total. This would mean roughly 15 hours per week. This should be viewed as a minimum - how much you get out of this course will depend on the work you put in.\nPenalties\nStudents must turn in all assignments on time by due dates. If students do not turn in an essay or assignment at a designated time, they will receive a zero for assignment this will be counted toward the final grade.\nMaterials and equipment and/or additional expenses\nYou will not be needing any additional equipment or materials.\nRecommended reading\nMost of the material students will be expected to read is published in journals and to some extent in books. Students will need to read between two and five articles per week. Set readings will mostly be supplied throughout the course (please check relevant week in BlackBoard). However, students will also be required to conduct their own independent reviews of the literature for assignment purposes.\nOther important information\nThe information above is specific to this course. There is other important information that students must familiarise themselves with, including:\nAcademic Integrity/Plagiarism\nAcademic Progress\nDates and deadlines\nFaculty of Science Student and Academic Services Office\nGrades\nSpecial passes Refer to the Assessment Handbook\nStatutes and policies\nStudent support\nStudents with disabilities\nStudent Charter\nTerms and Conditions\nTurnitin\nUniversity structure\nVUWSA\nTopics and Readings\nWeek 1: Overview\nWeek 2: Evolutionary Psychology\nCosmides, Leda, and John Tooby. “Evolutionary psychology: A primer.” (1997).

However please note that the full proposal summary (up to 200 words in length) is different from the shorter summary required in the EOI, both in terms of length and the intended audience. It should summarise the proposed research in straightforward language, but without loss of accuracy or excessive over-simplification. Note that this will be made publicly available should the proposal be successful, and may be published as part of the Marsden Fund’s publicity.\nIf the summary contains confidential or sensitive material, please indicate this at the summary start: “This summary contains sensitive or confidential information and will be released when the contract is completed”.\nAs for the EOI, the type of research activity is not accessible to anyone involved in the assessment of the proposals.\nSections 2a – 2d: Background, Overall Aim, Proposed Research and Vision Mātauranga\nIf no Vision Mātauranga theme is identified in Section 3, the total page limit for this section is five pages, with no set limit for each section within this.\nIf one or more Vision Mātauranga theme is identified in Section 3, the total page limit for this section is six pages, with no set limit for each section within this. Please read the definitions of these sections clearly, and avoid repetition.\nSection 2a: Background\nUse this section to give a context for the proposal by summarising in plain language the state of knowledge in the field.\nSection 2b: Overall Aim of the Research\nUse this section to state the general goals and specific objectives of the research proposal. Outline the potential for significant scholarly impact of your proposal (incorporating novelty, originality, insight and ambition).\nSection 2c: Proposed Research\nThis section should cover, where appropriate, the hypotheses being tested, the methodology to be used, sampling design, and methods of data analysis. Please ensure that your description covers the period of funding sought (up to three years), and that it includes contributions by collaborators and postgraduate students (if any).\nIf you identify one or more Vision Mātauranga themes in Section 3, please elaborate here how this fits in with your proposed research. For example, you may wish to discuss consultations and linkages, relevance, conceptual framework and/or proposal design, and outcomes (in addition to statements in Section 2d).\nWe are keen to see an increased emphasis on ethical considerations of the proposed research, particularly in the social sciences disciplines.\nIf the proposed research requires ethics approval, please use this section to show that you have considered all of the ethics issues associated with your research. Your discussion should satisfy the panel that your processes are meaningful, and for social science disciplines in particular, that you have fully considered how your methods will affect the communities you are working with. It is important that you do not concentrate solely on your theoretical argument at the neglect of methodology, implementation, and community safety.\nSection 2d: Vision Mātauranga\nPlease refer to earlier guidelines on Vision Mātauranga.\nIf you identify one or more Vision Mātauranga themes in Section 3, please include discussion of this within Section 2d, for example, on consultation and linkages, relevance, conceptual framework and/or proposal design, and outcomes.\nStatements on Vision Mātauranga should be contained within Section 2d, following the description of research (Sections 2a-2c). This is to enable Vision Mātauranga to be more easily integrated into the conceptual framework and/or research design. Where Vision Mātauranga is appropriate to a proposal, it can contribute to the overall excellence.\nCompliance aspects, such as access to culturally sensitive material and knowledge, should be covered in Section 2h, “Ethical or Regulatory Obligations”.\nAspects of Vision Mātauranga relating to relevant experience can be included in the “Roles and Resources” section (2g) and can also be incorporated into sections 2a-2c.\nSection 2e: References\nReferences for the Background, Overall Aims, Proposed Research and Vision Mātauranga sections (Sections 2a-d) should be listed here in Section 2e, and should not exceed three pages in length.\nSection 2f: Timetable\nDescribe in general terms the advances you hope to make in each year. It is acknowledged that this timetable may be revised as the research progresses.\nResources:\nClearly state the resources required for the proposed research that the team will have access to. This is an opportunity to discuss the practical requirements of your proposed research. For example: Access to libraries/collections/archives; access to required instruments/equipment/techniques/materials; ability to do fieldwork (e.g. site access, assistance, etc.); access to pools of participants.\nIf there are any special requirements for the proposed research, please explain how these will be met.\nSection 2h: Ethical or Regulatory Obligations\nAny permissions, approvals, etc., should be listed in this section.\nIt is your responsibility to ensure that all ethical or regulatory obligations are met (for example, from ERMA, MPI, Animal Ethics, Human Ethics). It is also your responsibility to organise access to facilities, fieldwork sites, archives, materials etc. This section should make clear that you have anticipated or gained the necessary formal approvals for your intended research, for instance, Department of Conservation permits, ERMA permits, and so forth.\nResearchers should plan the necessary approvals well in advance, to ensure no delays to the project should it be funded. Researchers should contact their institutional ethics committee and research offices for further information. Researchers will need to provide information on the current state of their ethics approval.\nNote that only compliance aspects related to ethical or regulatory considerations should be covered here. Ethical considerations in the context of the research methodology should be discussed in detail in the Proposed Research section (2c), as mentioned previously.\nSocial Research\nResearchers collecting personal information should be aware of their obligations around obtaining consents, data security, maintaining the anonymity of individuals, sensitivity around cultural issues and all other ethical considerations as appropriate. If there is any uncertainty, researchers should consult their institutional ethics committee.\nThere is a requirement that any researchers working with children follow the guidelines of their host institution’s child protection policy, in accord with section 19 of the Vulnerable Children’s Act 2014. Should the host institution not have a child protection policy, researchers should comply with the Society’s guidelines:\nhttps://royalsociety.org.nz/who-we-are/our-rules-and-codes/policy-on-child-protection/child-protection-policy/\nVision Mātauranga (Updated for 2020)\nThese are the updated guidelines which were included in the 2020 EOI Guidelines. They are also available at https://www.royalsociety.org.nz/what-we-do/funds-and-opportunities/marsden/marsden-fund-application-process/submitting-a-proposal/vision-matauranga/\nBackground\nVision Mātauranga is a policy about innovation, opportunity and the creation of knowledge that highlights the potential contribution of Māori knowledge, resources and people.\nhttps://royalsociety.org.nz/what-we-do/funds-and-opportunities/marsden/application/submitting-a-proposal/vision-matauranga/\nhttp://www.mbie.govt.nz/info-services/science-innovation/agencies-policies-budget-initiatives/vision-matauranga-policy/?searchterm=vision%20matauranga%2A\nThere are four themes:\nIndigenous Innovation, which involves contributing to economic growth through distinctive research and development;\nTaiao, which is concerned with achieving environmental sustainability through iwi and hapū relationships with land and sea;\nHauora/Oranga, which centres around improving health and social wellbeing; and Mātauranga, which involves exploring indigenous knowledge.\nVision Mātauranga and the Marsden Fund\nPlease note that Vision Mātauranga is now included as an assessment criterion:\nProposals should consider the relation of the research to the themes of Vision Mātauranga and, where relevant, how the project will engage with Māori.\nAt the Full Proposal round, up to one additional page will be available for statements on Vision Mātauranga immediately following the description of research in Sections 2a-2c. This is to enable Vision Mātauranga to be more easily integrated into the conceptual framework and/or research design. Where Vision Mātauranga is appropriate to a proposal, it can contribute to the assessment of its overall excellence.\nHow do I decide whether to include a Vision Mātauranga statement in my proposal?\nA Vision Mātauranga statement must be included for all research that has relevance for Māori. The research category descriptions outlined in the next section may help you decide if this applies to your project. Please note, however, that those categories are fluid, there may well be overlap between them, and not every point in each category need apply.\nCategories of Research\nThe five categories identified below have been adapted from those on the National Science Challenge, Biological Heritage website https://bioheritage.nz/about-us/vision-matauranga/ hosted by Manaaki Whenua Landcare Research. Please note that there may well be overlap between categories as in categories 2 and 3 in terms of the nature and degree of relevance to Māori.\nThe original categories were set out by MBIE in information for the Endeavour Fund c. 2015.\n1. Research with no specific Māori component\nNo mātauranga Māori (Māori knowledge) is used. Māori are not associated with the research process (e.g. not on any research management / advisory / governance panels, it is not inclusive of Māori land or institutions, nor the subject of any component of the research). Work is not likely to be of greater direct relevance to Māori than members of any other group. ##### 2. Research specifically relevant to Māori This category includes research projects where:\nThere is specific relevance to Māori. Mātauranga Māori may be used in a minor way to guide the work and its relevance to Māori. It includes work that contributes to Māori aspirations and outcomes.\n3. Research involving Māori\nThis category includes research projects where:\nMātauranga Māori may be incorporated in the project, but is not central to the project. Research is specifically and directly relevant to Māori and Māori are involved in the design and/or undertaking of the research. The work typically contributes to Māori (e.g., iwi / hapū, organisations) aspirations and outcomes.\n4. Māori-centred research\nThis category includes research projects where:\nThe project is Māori led, and where Mātauranga Māori is used alongside other knowledges (e.g. through frameworks, models, methods, tools, etc.). Kaupapa Māori research is a key focus of the project. Research is typically collaborative or consultative, with direct input from Māori groups, commonly including Māori researchers or a collaboration with Māori researchers or researchers under the guidance/mentoring of Māori. There is alignment with and contribution to Māori (e.g., iwi / hapū, organisations) aspirations.\n5. Kaupapa Māori research\nThis category includes research projects where:\nMātauranga Māori is incorporated, used and understood, as a central focus of project and its findings.\nResearch is grounded in te ao Māori and connected to Māori philosophies and principles. Research typically uses kaupapa Māori research methodologies.\nTe reo Māori may be a central feature to this kaupapa or research activity, and key researchers have medium to high cultural fluency or knowledge of tikanga and reo. The research is generally led by a Māori researcher; non-Indigenous researchers may carry out research under the guidance/mentoring of a Māori researcher. Māori participation (iwi/hapū/marae/individual) is high. The work contributes strongly to Māori (e.g., iwi/hapū, organisations) aspirations and outcomes and is mana enhancing.\nIV. Developing a Vision Mātauranga statement\nIt is important to keep in mind that there is no single approach or prescription for Vision Mātauranga: one size does not fit all and there are many possible ways of addressing Vision Mātauranga. Vision Mātauranga should not, however, be seen as an add-on, nor should it be treated as separate from the research, methods or people involved in the project. A holistic approach that considers reciprocity and relationships is therefore desirable.\nVision Mātauranga does not begin and end with your Vision Mātauranga statement. You should document how you have considered Vision Mātauranga and demonstrate applicable actions and relationships throughout the research. The following questions may be useful to consider when conceptualising and writing your project:\nHave you co-created the research topic/issue with an iwi or Māori organisation? What does working in partnership with iwi mean to you as researchers?\nTo what extent have you discussed the research with Māori partners and agreed on the methodology you will use?\nWas there full disclosure and informed consent to the proposed research with Māori partners? How has that agreement/informed consent been agreed to?\nHas budget been disclosed and agreed to with Māori partners?\nIs there provision in that budget for Māori involvement, capability development and consultation?\nIs there appropriate Māori researcher involvement in the project, both in terms of PI/AIs and capability development?\nWhat provisions have you made to ensure there is advice from appropriate Māori organisations throughout the life of the research project?\nIf there are concerns or disagreements with Māori partners, how are these to be resolved?\nWhat provisions have you made to ensure there is appropriate technology transfer to Māori partners as the research proceeds and as findings become available towards the end of the project?\nAre there benefits to Māori? What are they? And how have these been agreed with Māori partners?\nHow is the project an opportunity to build the capacity of Māori researchers or students in your discipline?\nHow will you share the research outcomes with Māori?\nHas there been agreement about the intellectual property ownership of research findings with Māori partners?\nWhat is the nature of that agreement?\nIs there a need for members of the research team to be proficient in te reo? How has this aspect been addressed?\nIs there a Tiriti o Waitangi component or requirement in your research?\nIs the research mana enhancing?\nV. Vision Mātauranga Resources\nBelow you will find a non-exhaustive list of published resources that describe, discuss, and talk about how researchers have engaged with Vision Mātauranga and kaupapa Māori research. These range from early conceptions of Vision Mātauranga to more recent frameworks. The resources underscore the diverse ways Vision Mātauranga may be approached across disciplines and methodologies.\nAllen, W., Jamie M. Ataria, J. M., Apgar, J. M., Harmsworth, G., and Tremblay, L.
